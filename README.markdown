the top rown controls the rate of chord repition

* cells 0,0 to 3,4 choose a tonic (pitch moves chromatically to the right, and in tritones vertically from bottom to top).
* cells 4,0 to 7,1 choose a chord quality.  This is a little screwed up right now, I think.  It doesn't sound quite right.
* cells 0,4 to 7,4 choose the chord's octave.
* cells 7,0 to 7,7 choose a rate that the chords will repeat at.

(yes, there's a lot of empty space still.  That should be getting filled in.)
